### **Introduction/Description of project**

Weather can make a huge impact in our lives. It is not only important to us, but it is also an essential to our daily survival.
In this project I am going to present how weather in Houston, Texas, specifically of rainfall and temperature, can be predicted in advance using historical daily weather (i.e.  precipitation, rain, and temperature) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

### **Goal**
•	Weather prediction such as rainfall is one of the major concerns in the field of meteorology. Several techniques I believed that they will help to predict the weather are based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. 
•	My goal is to use various Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods to assist with rainfall and temperature predictions.
